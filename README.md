# Unit 4 - Abstract Art Project

## Introduction

Data visualizations are powerful tools to present information and convey patterns and relationships. Sometimes visualizations are charts or graphs, and other times they are more abstract pieces of art. Your goal is to create a visual representation relating at least two categories from your dataset that engages your viewer and encourages them to learn more about your chosen topic.

## Dataset

The dataset was AI generated
	•	Names (String): The names of the universities.
	•	Rankings (int): The global ranking of each university.
	•	Tuitions (int): The yearly tuition fees for each university in USD.
	•	Acceptances (int): The acceptance rate of each university as a percentage.
